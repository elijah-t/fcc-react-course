1. What do props help us accomplish?

Props allow us to reuse components for a set of data.

2. How do you pass a prop into a component?

Pass it into the component like an HTML attribute.

e.g. <Welcome name="">

3. Can I pass a custom prop (e.g. `blahblahblah={true}`) to a native
   DOM element? (e.g. <div blahblahblah={true}>) Why or why not?

No, because native DOM elements have their own set attributes (e.g. style, width).

4. How do I receive props in a component?
function Navbar(props)) {
    return (
        <header>
            ...
        </header>
    )
}

In the function arguments, enter in the props argument.

5. What data type is `props` when the component receives it?

Props is a Javascript object.
