1. Why do we need to `import React from "react"` in our files?

JS does not support React on its own.

2. If I were to console.log(page) in index.js, what would show up?

A Javascript object since JSX is not HTML, it returns JS objects


3. What's wrong with this code:
```
const page = (
     <h1>Hello</h1>
     <p>This is my website!</p>
